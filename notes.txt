Initial phase:
- Define the HTML content
  |_ Container div, including a class
     |_ This div will contain the entire grid
     |_ The container will be styled (flex-direction: row;, flex-wrap: wrap; as guidance) 
- Create the functionality
  |_ Creating the divs
  |_ Creating the button to increase the amount of divs generated (16x16, 64x64, 128x128 etc.)



- CSS styling
  |_ This will be the final undertaking
  |_ Make sure everything pops nicely
  |_ !!DO NOT!! research / use CSS-Grid, as this has not been taught yet up to this point
